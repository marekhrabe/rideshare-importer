Import your history of trips from ride sharing applications.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to import your personal hisotry of rides from ride sharing services into individual posts. Currently, Uber is the only supported provider.

= What gets Imported? =

Each trip gets saved as a separate post with contents of:

- Map image
- Pickup & dropoff addresses
- Trip duration
- Trip mileage
- Driver name
- Fare and currency

More info is stored in post_meta:

- Trip id (used to identify previously imported trips)
- Full JSON data about the trip, as known from the imported file
- Encoded map coordinates so you can render your own map in your theme or plugin

If plugin [People & Places](https://github.com/beaulebens/people-places) is active, it will be used to tag posts with driver profiles using its People taxonomy.

= Imported File Format =

Since there is no public API which could be used to retrieve the full history, this importer uses a file format generated by a browser extension *RideShare Trip Stats* you must run on the website of the provider.

The RideShare Trip Stats extension is not associated with this plugin. It's open source and you can install it from its [Github repository](https://github.com/jonluca/RideShare-Trip-Stats) or its [Chrome Webstore listing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rideshare-trip-stats/kddlnbejbpknoedebeojobofnbdfhpnm).

This importer has been designed to work well together with other [Keyring Social Importers](https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-social-importers/) by using similar ways to tag post with post_meta. The reason this importer is not included directly there is that it requires a JSON file to be manually exported and uploaded into the importer. All other importers in Keyring use an API connection but sadly, for ride sharing, API access is very limited.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `rideshare-importer` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
