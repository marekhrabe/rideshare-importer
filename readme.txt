Import your history of trips from ride sharing applications.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to import your personal hisotry of rides from ride sharing services into individual posts. Currently, Uber is the only supported provider.

= What gets Imported? =

Each trip gets saved as a separate post with contents of:

- Map image
- Pickup & dropoff addresses
- Trip duration
- Trip mileage
- Driver name
- Fare and currency

More info is stored in post_meta:

- Trip id (used to identify previously imported trips)
- Full JSON data about the trip, as known from the imported file
- Encoded map coordinates so you can render your own map in your theme or plugin

If plugin [People & Places](https://github.com/beaulebens/people-places) is active, it will be used to tag posts with driver profiles using its People taxonomy.

= Imported File Format =

Since there is no public API which could be used to retrieve the full history, this importer uses a file format generated by a browser extension *RideShare Trip Stats* (v2.2 or higher) which you must run on the website of the provider.

The RideShare Trip Stats extension is not associated with this plugin. It's open source and you can install it from its [Github repository](https://github.com/jonluca/RideShare-Trip-Stats) or its [Chrome Webstore listing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rideshare-trip-stats/kddlnbejbpknoedebeojobofnbdfhpnm).

This importer has been designed to work well together with other [Keyring Social Importers](https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-social-importers/) by using similar ways to tag post with post_meta. The reason this importer is not included directly there is that it requires a JSON file to be manually exported and uploaded into the importer. All other importers in Keyring use an API connection but sadly, for ride sharing, API access is very limited.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `rideshare-importer` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
